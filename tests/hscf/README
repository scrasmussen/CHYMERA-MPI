hscf is the Hachisu Self Consistent Field code. It is used to 
calculate equilibrium disk models as initial conditions for
runs in CHYMERA.

To create an equilibrium model.
1) Edit prmtr.h and hscf.in as needed.
2) Compile hscf.f, run compiled code with hscf.in as input.
3) Check polyout to see that model converged.
4) Copy fort.93 to fort.2 in your CHYMERA-MPI/run folder.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
prmtr.h: SET jmax,kmax
Choose r-radial and z-height grid dimensions (integers j and k in the code).
CHYMERA augments this slice by creating a surface of revolution,
a disk, for the fully 3D runs.

hscf.in: SET pin,np,jold,kold,jout,kout,lgrhomax,del,starnot
See below for detailedish explanaition of variables.

 case, enter 1,2 to construct a polytrope, white dwarf respectively.
 rinit, enter 1 to read old rho.dat, or 0 to use all 1.0. 

 pin,np,jold,kold,jout,kout,lgrhomax,del,starnot

     pin is the polytropic index.
     np is nprime (for  infinity, enter a value .gt. 3.0);
     jold is the previous jout;
     kold is the previous kout;
     jout and kout set the axis ratio. note that the ratio is
       (kout-2)/(jout-2);
     the log max dens we use 0;
     del is the percentage of the previous iteration to keep. The flatter
       flatter you get the closer to 1.o del needs to be.  Typically, 0.8
       or 0.9 works well.
     starnot is the ration of star to diskmass, mass_star/mass_disk.
